Bitcoin has a market capitalization --- meaning coin price in dollars multiplied by total number of coins --- of around $2 trillion. This is a large enough number that something new, like T-coin, might have a meaningful impact on the US debt.

How much might T-coin help the US? Note that Dogecoin, a digital currency based on the Bitcoin protocol but created initially as a joke, has a market cap of around \$64 billion. If Bitcoin is worth 33 times more than Dogecoin, despite being a fundamentally similar creation, why couldn't T-coin be worth 50 times more than Bitcoin? At that valuation, just the premined portion of T-coin would allow the US Government to pay-off most of its \$36+ trillion debt. The coins which came to the Government as the system continued to run in the years which followed would contribute significantly to future spending.

How is this possible? How could the US Government create, out of nothing, a digital currency which would allow it to pay off a \$33 trillion debt? The magic happens when we capture the [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) benefit of creating the first government-supported, anonymous, decentralized currency.
