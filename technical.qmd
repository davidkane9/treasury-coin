title: "Technical Considerations"
---

This page will discuss some technical considerations.

<!-- We can use hidden comments to discuss planning. -->

<!-- Initial draft needs a few bullet points which highlight the most important changes we propose to make, like a larger block size and so on. The document assumes a certain amount of technical background in its readers.  -->

<!-- A second draft might begin with some background on blockchain/bitcoin, or at least good sources so that readers can learn more.  -->
