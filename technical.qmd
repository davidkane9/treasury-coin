<!-- 1. Make some detailed recommendations. What do you think would be best? Of course, the text would note that this is just one possibility, that other options are reasonable. But it would be useful to see what one smart person (you!) thinks is best, especially with regard to block size and block time.  -->

<!-- 2. Provide more links to definitions/descriptions of various terms, the ones you do (like Beacon and the Merge) are good and useful!  -->

<!-- 3. Begin with some background on blockchain/bitcoin, or at least good sources so that readers can learn more. -->


Some technical considerations:

* The current average block time on Bitcoin is calibrated to be around ten minutes. Depending on the use cases in mind for the T-chain, we can very simply lower the average block time by reducing the difficulty of the proof-of-work task, possibly down to fifteen seconds, which was the block time on Ethereum when it used proof-of-work.

* The current block size on Bitcoin is constrained to 4 MB. Similar to Bitcoin Cash, we can simply increase the block size of the T-chain to handle many more transactions.

* The maximum supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, which lends it credibility and enduring value. The T-coin is not meant to replace the dollar, hence its maximum supply should probably be capped like Bitcoin rather than subject to USG monetary policy. However, depending on the use cases, we can simply modify the maximum supply of the T-chain to be variable, allowing it to exceed 21 million, similar to the maximum supply of Dogecoin which is uncapped.

* A valid criticism of proof-of-work is its environmental impact: as of 2024 the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining is comparable to that of Poland. Similar to Ethereum during [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/), the T-chain can consider a future migration from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. If this migration is likely, from day one we can also launch a proof-of-work test chain similar to Ethereum's [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/) to ensure the sound and sustainable maintenance of proof-of-stake consensus, before switching the T-chain to use proof-of-stake.

* The main threat to a proof-of-work blockchain (including Bitcoin) is the 51% attack, where at least 51% of the mining power of the blockchain colludes to create and validate fraudulent blocks to the chain. Given the prominence of the T-chain from day one as sponsored by the USG, nation-state adversaries might possibly have incentives to launch 51% attacks against it. To prevent these threat vectors, the T-chain should prepare, before its launch, a significant reserve of mining power which is guaranteed to not partake in any such attacks, and which is large enough to maintain at least 51% of the mining power of the blockchain even in the face of such attacks.
