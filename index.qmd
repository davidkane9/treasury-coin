title: "Treasury Coin"

The United States Government should create a "Treasury Coin" --- call it "T-coin" for short --- based on the protocol behind Bitcoin. T-coin would be the first government-supported, anonymous, decentralized currency. Key points:

* The benefits of [seigniorage](seigniorage.html) mean that Teasury Coin might contribute trillions of dollars to the Federal Government. First, before releasing the project to the public, we could "[premine](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premining.asp)" a third or so of the total number of coins. Second, we could make a simple change in the protocol by which the US Government would receive a fraction of the coin reward each time a new block is created.

* All the code for the Bitcoin blockchain is open source. There are no secrets. Nothing prevents us from copying Bitcoin down to the very last detail. Call this new blockchain the "T-chain".

* The Government could support the project by allowing people and businesses to pay their taxes with T-coin. Allowing, or even requiring, the use of a new currency for paying taxes is a tried and true method for governments throughout history to incentivise the use of a new currency.

* Our Treasury Coin plan is completely different from the usual [Central Bank Digital Currency plans](cbdc.html). 

* We still use dollars. Federal workers are paid in dollars. Social security checks are denominated in dollars. The value of T-coins will float relative to dollars. The USG could bring some stability to the value of T-coins by having a regular off-chain auction, similar to the auctions which the US Treasury currently holds for new debt issuance. A daily (or weekly or monthly) auction for T-coins could set the "official" exchange rate for T-coins to dollars until the next auction, thereby decreasing, at least somewhat, its volatility for everyday use.

* T-coins are likely to be much more useful than bitcoins because the US Government would have every incentive to ensure that they are. Every action which makes T-coins more valuable causes a significant increase in the dollar value of the T-coins which the USG already owns (after premining) and which it will continue to receive as new coins are mined. The USG could encourage and/or require various entities to accept T-coins for payment.

* T-coins are likely to be the most secure blockchain currency in the world because the US Government would have every incentive to make it secure.

* Other major countries are likely already considering the launch of their own digital currencies that compete with Bitcoin. It is important for the US to signal strength by being first to launch such a project, so that the future of cryptocurrencies is *made in America*.
